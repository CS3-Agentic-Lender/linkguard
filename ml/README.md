Dataset, feature engineering and model training for LinkGuard.

## Get the dataset

We train on the **PhiUSIIL Phishing URL (Website)** dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: 235,795 labelled URLs with 54 features. The CSV is about 54 MB, so it is not in git. Each person downloads their own copy.

### 1. Download

Go to the dataset page and click **Download** (top right):

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/967/phiusiil+phishing+url+dataset

You get a zip called `phiusiil+phishing+url+dataset.zip` (about 15 MB).

Or, from the repo root on macOS or Linux:

```bash
curl -L -o phiusiil.zip "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/967/phiusiil+phishing+url+dataset.zip"
```

### 2. Put the CSV in `ml/data/`

Unzip it and move the CSV so the path is exactly:

```
ml/data/PhiUSIIL_Phishing_URL_Dataset.csv
```

From the repo root:

```bash
mkdir -p ml/data
unzip -o phiusiil.zip -d ml/data
rm phiusiil.zip
```

Keep the file name as it is. Code in `ml/` reads it from that path.

### 3. Check it

```bash
ls -lh ml/data/PhiUSIIL_Phishing_URL_Dataset.csv   # about 54M
git status                                          # nothing new to commit
```

If `git status` lists the CSV, stop and tell the team. It means the ignore rules have changed, and the file must never be committed.

## Where files live

| Path | Holds | In git? |
|---|---|---|
| `ml/data/` | The downloaded dataset and any cleaned copies | No, the whole folder is ignored |
| `ml/models/` | Trained model and scaler files (`*.joblib`, `*.pkl`) | No, those file types are ignored |

Training code saves the model and scaler to `ml/models/`, and the backend loads them from there. Like the dataset, they are shared outside git.
